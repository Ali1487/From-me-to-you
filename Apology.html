Dear Cousin Sister,

I don’t need a thousand words to tell you this…

I’m sorry.

For the things I said, the behaviour,
and the ways I treated you.

You are my best best best Cousin Sister — and I must apologies to you.

I want to say more things to and talk to you!!!
For now I will say that I understood that the thing which was in my mind was just a attraction.I know you also indulge in that things and stuff because of Me(World's Biggest Idiot).
I am such a fool who crossed all the limts and probably did a sin for which God will not forgive me. I can do only one thing i.e asking for sorry.I just want forgiveness from you.

Please forgive me.
Let me hold your heart more gently, more truly.
I want the bond we had before.

If you have forgiven me please give a chance,Now I just need a clear conversation with you.

Forever yours,
Cousin brother
